## 🧮 Calculation Engine

### Unit Conversion System
```typescript
// Precise conversions with Decimal.js
const areaHa = new Decimal(25.5)
const productRateL = new Decimal(2.0)
const totalProduct = areaHa.mul(productRateL) // 51.0 L

// Active ingredient calculations
const concentrationPct = new Decimal(54.0) // GlyphoMax 540
const aiGrams = totalProduct.mul(concentrationPct).div(100).mul(1000)
```

### LabelGuard Rules Engine
```typescript
// Compose constraints from multiple products
const rules = LabelGuard.combineLabelRules([
  { productName: 'GlyphoMax 540', label: glyphoMaxRules },
  { productName: 'MCPA 750', label: mcpaRules }
])

// Real-time validation
const result = LabelGuard.checkRules(rules, currentConditions)
if (!result.passes) {
  showViolations(result.violations)
  suggestRemediations(result.violations)
}
```

### DriftShield Risk Assessment
```typescript
// Calculate multi-factor drift risk
const risk = DriftShield.calculateDriftRisk({
  windKph: 15,
  windDirDeg: 180,
  tempC: 28,
  rhPct: 45,
  boomHeading: 90,
  nozzleType: 'Medium'
})

// Risk score: 0-100 with factor breakdown
console.log(`Overall Risk: ${risk.riskScore}%`)
console.log(`Wind Factor: ${risk.factors.windRisk}%`)
console.log(`Cross-wind: ${risk.factors.crossWindRisk}%`)
```

## 🔬 Key Innovations

The system runs quick 10-second simulations varying wind ±2 km/h and direction ±10° to generate predictive risk heatmaps before starting a job.

### 2. Safe Window Finder
Automatically scans weather forecasts to identify optimal 15-minute spray windows, ranked by risk score.

### 3. Label DSL (Domain Specific Language)
```json5
{
  "maxWindKph": 15,
  "disallowedWindDirDeg": [90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95],
  "bufferZones": [
    { "type": "water", "minDistanceM": 20 }
  ],
  "reentryHours": 6,
  "maxSeasonalGaiPerHa": 1200,
  "temperatureRange": { "minC": 10, "maxC": 35 }
}
```

### 4. Mix Coach
